        <h3>I have done many projects form making games to javascrpit to doing graphics in c++</h3>
        <p>I made an escape game where you play as a slime and you go thru a lab to find anyway to escape.</p>
        <strong>sadly I don't have the files anymore so can't show a photo.</strong>
        <p>I have also coded minesweeper and snake in javascrpit</p>
        <br>
        <h3>I have plans to make a release a game in the upcoming years but don't want to spoil it here.</h3>
